app.post('/zoom/webhook', async (req, res) => {
  const { recording_url, meeting_id } = req.body;

  // Download recording
  const audioFile = await downloadRecording(recording_url);

  // Transcribe with speaker diarization
  const transcript = await whisperAPI.transcribe(audioFile, {
    diarization: true,
    timestamps: true,
    language: 'auto'
  });

  // Extract action items using AI
  const actionItems = await extractActionItems(transcript);
